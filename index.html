                              <h2>History</h2>
                              <p class="item-intro text-muted" style="text-align:left;">The history told below is a collection and retelling of the ninety-two years of Pi Kappa Phi, Alpha Gamma Chapter. The decision for our chapter to publish and retell this information was in the continued hope that it will benifit our brother chapters and satisfy the men who hold the highest offices of our fraternity in their quest for the betterment of our brotherhood. Let it also speak to the character of our men, and standards of our organization in goodwill, so that all will know we are perpetually working toward the ideal chapter.</p>
                              <div style="text-align:left">
                                  <p>The twenty-third Chapter of Pi Kappa Phi, Alpha Gamma was orginally colonized in 1921 by several members of Phi Chapter (University of Tulsa) who transferred to the University of Oklahoma. The colonization period lasted approximately two years, during which time the original twenty-five members of the then "Pi Kappa" social fraternity tried to convince the National Fraternity that they were indeed worthy of a charter.</p>
                                  <p>The 1923 Supreme Chapter meeting was held in Atlanta, Georgia. Among the business tended to at that meeting was the establishment of the National Office, the appoinment of an Executive Secretary, and the chartering of the Alpha Gamma Chapter at The University of Oklahoma. On May 26th 1923, George Driver, Supreme Alumni Secretary; Harve L. Rice, Chapter Inspector of the Nebraska area; and Glen Hilford, W.A Setser, Joe Crimble, and Lawerence Johnson, all of Phi Chapter at Tulsa, initiated the following men:</p>
                                  <p>Horace Mann, Hugh Perry, Maurice Elleson, Dale Kile, E.H. Skinner, Foster Monahan, W.P Scarlett, Clarence Cochran, Bennie McLyea, Harold Hulpieu, Bill Armstrong, Edward Mars, John Crowder, J.H. Robinson, Clyde Miles, W.D Baird,             Ray Cornelison, Andrew Long, Roy E. Newman, James Penick, Charles E. Springer, Cleo Ingle, Sidney Perry, Dan Perry,   Byron Dawson, Ed Woods, Granville Norris, Lester P. Smith, Orville E. Preistley, Edgar Johns, Xellis Winkinson, Dave Pankratz. (For whom we hold their names dearly, and perpetually strive to continue their work and dreams)</p>
                                  <p>Alpha Gamma now became the second chapter chartered in the Missouri Valley. During this time, the men occupied a house at 304 South Webster. During the fall semester of 1924, Alpha Gamma accepted five pledges and changed their place of residence to 523 University Boulevard.</p>
                                  <p>The pledges are listed as: Byron Baird, Bob Hudson, Quinn Diskason, Warren Ash, and Virgil Cornelison. The fall of 1925 saw the initiation of eight more pledges.</p>
                                  <p>In 1926, The Chapter again changed locations, this time to 757 Debarr Street where it remained until 1931. During this era, the Chapter was involved in every aspect of university life.</p>
                                  <p>In 1931, with the aid of prominent alumni such as Dr. Hugh Perry, Eshthemer Skinner, oil operator, and Dr. J.W Robinson, Pi Kappa Phi moved into a newly built house located at 702 Lahoma then valued at $65,000 (About $3,000,000 today).</p>
                                  <p>The 1934 and 1935 annuals report the Pi Kapps to have been located at 523 Lahoma, a very nice, colonial style house that seems to have been built as a scaled down version of the larger "Mansion" at 702 Lahoma. However, debts continued to plague the members until 1936 when, with a dwindling membership and in the midst of the Oklahoma Depression (As well as the national depression) the Alpha Gamma Chapter of Pi Kappa Phi was forced to relinquish their charter and to go "off campus." Many of the men soon joined the service of their country and a great number continued to serve during WWII. Their love of Pi Kappa Phi did not diminish, however, as is proven by their commitment to establish the Alpha Gamma Alumni Association in 1968.</p>
                                  <p>When the Alpha Gamma Chapter was officially re-colonized on October 31, 1969, there was a great deal of excitement amongst the seven newest pledges and amongst the members of the Alpha Gamma Alumni Association. The Chapter which had laid dormant for a third of the century was awakened and the drive for fraternity and brotherhood began once more. The eighteen months that followed were filled with planning and organizing. A house was occupied by the men-out of which they could rush and make new contacts. This house, at 707 Timberdell was held until the Fall of 1971. Alpha Gamma alum and member of the National office, Mel Metcalf, was sent with several others in rechartering efforts. Alpha Gamma regained its Charter on the first day of May 1971. The most unusual aspect of the year was undoubtedly the living arrangements. The Alpha Gamma Chapter, thanks to to efforts of Jerry Matthews and Sandy Kinney (an Alpha Gamma Delta Sorority Alumnus) was allowed to rent half of the upstairs of the AGD Sorority house in which they would live. It was the first coed fraternity/sorority living arrangement in the country.</p>
                                  <p>During the next three years, the Alpha Gamma Chapter and the Alpha Gamma Delta sorority attended many functions and events together. From the Greek Week Competition where they paired as a coed team, the two houses proved to the University, the Greek system and the entire country that co-habitation was possible. Eventually, however the post war, anti-Greek sentiment faded. The individualism that had been evident across the campus returned to its low status as students realized the necessity for brotherhood and sisterhood. With this change in attitude came the increase in membership in both the Alpha Gamma Delta sorority and the Alpha Gamma Chapter of Pi Kappa Phi. The men of Alpha Gamma at that time then aquired the house formerly belonging to Sigma Delta Tau which had been placed in inactive status on campus. With this move, the men began the need for responsibility and financial security. The 1977 Pi Kapps did extremely well academically placing fourth in the Greek system for overall gpa.</p>
                                  <p>Unfortunately, it becomes evident in the Sooner Alpha Gamma newsletters of this period just how important finances were becoming. The house at 1714 Chautauqua, although very pleasing in its design and its appearance, never reached completion in its construction. Originally, the Sigma Delta Tau Sorority had intended to build two wings onto the house, each housing forty students, for a total of eighty. The second wing was never added and subsequently the house became almost impossible to sustain (in the black) even when forty men occupied it (a full house as it stands). The house has been described as "financially impossible to operate efficiently". Forty men in the house became more than just a luxury, it was a necessity.</p>
                                  <p>The late seventies were not all bad, however. The Pi Kapps continued to excel in grades and in other areas on campus and off. In 1980 Alpha Gamma Chapter recieved a Master Chapter Award of Excellence from the National Office. The rush tours and formal rush sessions were continually successful as well and it looked as though the Chapter had truly hit its stride. The next few years were filled with too many ups and downs until a great faction developed in the 1983-1984 school year. Following Christmas break that year many members resigned their memberships and the final chapter President of that era, Jim Gonders, voluntarily withdrew from the house and closed the chapter indefinitely.</p>
                                  <p>In 1986, the National Fraternity decided to recolonize the Alpha Gamma Chapter. During the next two years the men of this chapter worked hard to regain its charter. Members finally received the Alpha Gamma Charter in 1988. In the next couple of years, rush and membership went well for the new fraternity but members were unaware of the problems growing inside their chapter. In Spring 1992, the National Office cleaned out the chapter by placing everyone on alumni status except for six members who were asked to stay to recolonize. With these men and new recruits in the coming years, they hoped to build a fraternity based on brotherhood, but did not forget the lessons learned in the past.</p>
                                  <p>The next 16 years saw many ups and downs once more. The chapter achieved many great succeses and the members turned the house at 1714 Chautauqua into something more than just a fraternity house. In 2008 the Chapter once more surrendered its charter because of inability to meet required national standards.</p>
                                  <p>These national standards were set because of the example the Chapter had previously set nationally and consequently National leaders came back to Norman in 2011 to search for campus leaders. Ever since we look back and reflect heavily on the history of our Chapter and emphasize its importantance to our identity. Our chapter today can attribute so much of what we have and who we are, to the men who worked perpetually to build the ideal brotherhood since 1921. With that said, We are the proud men of Alpha Gamma Chapter and we will endure.</p>
